/**
 * `BriefingMaker` encapsulates the algorithm to make a briefing, using `BattleDataReader`, `AgendaStore` (or, more specifically,

 * In broad terms, this works as follows:
 * When the `BriefingMaker` is told to make a new briefing, it will look for the file `tempArenaInfo.json` in the World of Warships
 * replay directory. If it finds such a file, it will read the battle data from it and enrich it with `Ship` objects for all 
 * participating player, using its `GameObjectFactory` to do so. 
 *
 * It will then request all known `Agenda`s from its `AgendaStore` (generally, the `AgendaStore` will do this by reading all agenda
 * definitions from the quartersbrief agenda directory, but this is, of course, up to the `AgendaStore` implementation). Among these,
 * the agenda to use is chosen using the provided `strategy`. 
 *
 * Finally, a briefing is built using a `BriefingBuilder` on the battle and agenda. (See there for details on how the agenda's topics 
 * are processed and turned into briefing content.)

 * @see AgendaStore
 * @see SpecificityStrategy
